This is another file for me to play in.
It's got a few lines...

for thing in ['python','java','C++']:
  print 'and a bit of', thing

We can add a line here 3rd to see what happens...

Initially we can add some stuff into the dev branch
We will also add stuff to the master branch to see
what happens when we merge the two...

Also we'll add a line HERE 3rd...
